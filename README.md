ATM-INTERFACE-App
Create a fully dynamic ATM application using the Spring Boot Framework.
 *********************************************************************************
Project Overview
Objective: Develop a dynamic ATM interface application using Java and the Spring Boot framework with a focus on MVC architecture, database integration, and JSP for the frontend.

***********************************************************************************
Steps to Set Up and Develop the Application
Step 1: Set Up Spring Boot Project
Use Spring Tool Suite (STS) to set up the Spring Boot project.
Step 2: Project Configuration
Project Type: Maven
Language: Java
Add the following dependencies:

Spring Web: For building web applications (REST APIs).
Spring Data JPA: For database interaction using JPA.
Spring Boot DevTools: For development-time features like hot reloading.
MySQL Connector: For connecting to the MySQL database.
JSP: For building the user interface (frontend).

Step 3: Create the Entity and Repository Layer
Define the entities (models) representing the ATM app's core data structures (e.g., Account, Transaction).
Create corresponding repositories using Spring Data JPA for database operations.

Step 4: Build the Service Layer
Implement the business logic of the application in the service layer.
Services will interact with the repository layer to manage data processing and operations.
Step 5: Set Up the Controller Layer

Create the necessary controller classes to handle HTTP requests and route them to appropriate services.
Controllers will manage endpoints for actions like checking balances, withdrawing cash, and depositing funds.

Step 6: Develop the JSP Frontend
Design the frontend using JSP (JavaServer Pages) for a dynamic user interface.
Create views for the different operations such as login, account overview, withdrawal, deposit, and transaction history.

Step 7: Configure Application Properties
Configure application.properties or application.yml for the project.
Set up database connection parameters (MySQL URL, username, password).
Enable other necessary Spring configurations.

Step 8: Run the Application
Build and run the Spring Boot application.
Access the application via the local web browser and test the functionality.
